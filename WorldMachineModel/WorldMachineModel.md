## 1. World (Environmental Assumptions)

The World component defines the external environment and assumptions under which the Signal Server system will operate.

### 1.1 Network Environment
The system assumes reliable internet connectivity exists between all components. Network infrastructure supports TCP/IP protocols with standard HTTP/HTTPS communication patterns. Internet service providers maintain sufficient bandwidth for real-time message transmission and media file transfers.

### 1.2 Client Device Environment
Mobile devices and desktop applications serve as primary client endpoints. These devices maintain internet connectivity through cellular networks, WiFi, or wired connections. Client devices possess cryptographic capabilities for end-to-end encryption operations and secure key generation.

### 1.3 Security Environment
The operational environment includes potential adversaries attempting to intercept communications. Government entities may request access to user communications in various jurisdictions. Network infrastructure may be compromised or monitored by third parties. Users require protection against metadata collection and traffic analysis.

### 1.4 Regulatory Environment
The system operates across multiple international jurisdictions with varying privacy laws and communication regulations. Data protection regulations such as GDPR and similar frameworks govern user data handling. Some jurisdictions may restrict or ban encrypted communication services.

### 1.5 Operational Environment
The service requires continuous availability with minimal downtime tolerance. User base may scale rapidly requiring horizontal scaling capabilities. System administration and maintenance activities occur without service interruption.

The system shall implement the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption using Double Ratchet algorithm for forward secrecy. Key agreement shall use X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) protocol for establishing secure channels. Message encryption shall use AES-256 in GCM mode with HMAC-SHA256 for authentication.

### 3.2 Communication Protocol Specifications
Client-server communication shall use WebSocket connections for real-time messaging with fallback to HTTP long-polling. Message serialization shall use Protocol Buffers for efficient data transmission. Transport layer security shall use TLS 1.3 or higher with certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 3.3 Database and Storage Specifications
User account information shall be stored with minimal metadata retention. Message content shall not be stored on servers after successful delivery. Cryptographic keys shall be stored using hardware security modules or equivalent secure storage mechanisms.

### 3.4 Authentication Specifications
User registration and authentication shall use phone number verification through SMS or voice calls. Session management shall implement secure token-based authentication with appropriate expiration policies. Multi-device authentication shall use secure device linking protocols.

### 3.5 API Specifications
RESTful APIs shall provide account management functionality including registration, profile updates, and device management. WebSocket APIs shall handle real-time message transmission with appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms. All API endpoints shall implement rate limiting and abuse prevention measures.

### 3.6 Privacy Specifications
Server logs shall not contain message content or detailed user activity patterns. IP address logging shall be minimized and anonymized where possible. Sealed sender functionality shall prevent servers from identifying message senders in group communications.
