# Signal Server World Model Requirements Specification

## Introduction

People around the world need to communicate privately and securely without worrying about governments, corporations, or malicious actors reading their personal messages, tracking their relationships, or analyzing their communication patterns. Traditional messaging services store user data, sell information to advertisers, cooperate with mass surveillance programs, and leave communications vulnerable to interception and abuse. While Signal clients handle the user interface and encryption on devices, they need a robust server infrastructure to route messages, manage user accounts, and coordinate secure communications between millions of users globally without compromising privacy. The Signal server must handle massive message volumes, maintain high availability, implement privacy-preserving protocols, and operate under constant threat from adversaries trying to compromise user security. Signal Foundation has the technical expertise, funding, and commitment to privacy needed to build and operate this critical server infrastructure at global scale.

## 1. World (Environmental Context)

The World defines the external environment, constraints, and assumptions under which the Signal Server system operates.

### 1.1 Network Environment
The system operates within a global internet infrastructure with varying connectivity patterns. Internet service providers maintain TCP/IP networks supporting HTTP/HTTPS protocols with sufficient bandwidth for real-time communication. Network infrastructure may experience intermittent connectivity, latency variations, and potential monitoring by third parties.

### 1.2 Client Device Environment
Users access the system through mobile devices (smartphones, tablets) and desktop computers across multiple operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux). These devices possess cryptographic processing capabilities, secure storage mechanisms, and maintain internet connectivity through cellular networks, WiFi, or wired connections. Device capabilities vary in processing power, storage capacity, and network reliability.

### 1.3 Security and Threat Environment
The operational environment contains multiple threat actors including potential eavesdroppers, man-in-the-middle attackers, and malicious network infrastructure. Government entities across various jurisdictions may attempt to access communications or metadata. Network traffic may be monitored, intercepted, or analyzed by adversaries seeking to compromise user privacy and security.

### 1.4 Regulatory and Legal Environment
The system operates across multiple international jurisdictions with diverse privacy laws, data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and communication oversight requirements. Some regions restrict or prohibit encrypted communication services. Legal frameworks may require data retention, user identification, or lawful access capabilities.

### 1.5 Infrastructure Environment
Cloud computing platforms provide scalable server infrastructure with geographic distribution capabilities. Database systems offer persistent storage with replication and backup capabilities. Content delivery networks enable global media distribution. Load balancing and monitoring systems support high-availability operations.

### 1.6 Operational Environment
The service operates continuously with global user base expectations for minimal downtime. User populations may experience rapid growth requiring dynamic scaling. System administration occurs across multiple time zones with varying maintenance windows and operational procedures.

Key derivation follows HKDF with SHA-256. Forward secrecy maintains separate encryption keys for each message direction.

Sealed sender functionality prevents server identification of message senders in group communications. Cryptographic operations use vetted libraries (libsignal-protocol, BouncyCastle) with hardware security module integration where available.

### 3.2 Communication Protocol Specifications
Client-server communication uses WebSocket connections for real-time messaging with HTTP long-polling fallback. Message serialization uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for efficient binary encoding. Transport security requires TLS 1.3 minimum with certificate pinning and HSTS enforcement.

API rate limiting implements token bucket algorithm with per-user and per-IP restrictions. Connection management handles reconnection with exponential backoff and maximum retry limits.

### 3.3 Authentication and Session Specifications

Account recovery provides secure mechanisms without compromising message history or encryption properties. Two-factor authentication integration supports TOTP and backup codes.

### 3.4 Data Storage Specifications
User account data storage minimizes metadata retention with automatic purging policies. Message content is not stored server-side after successful delivery. Temporary message storage uses memory-based queues with encryption.

Database schema implements proper indexing for performance with privacy-preserving query patterns. Backup systems encrypt data at rest using AES-256 with key rotation. Geographic data residency complies with regional requirements.

### 3.5 API and Interface Specifications
RESTful APIs provide account management (registration, profiles, devices) with OpenAPI documentation. WebSocket APIs handle real-time messaging with error handling and retry mechanisms. All endpoints implement authentication, authorization, and input validation.

API versioning supports backward compatibility during client updates. Response formats use consistent JSON schemas with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

### 3.6 Privacy and Compliance Specifications
Server logging excludes message content and detailed user activity patterns. IP address handling implements anonymization and minimal retention policies. Sealed sender prevents server correlation of message senders and recipients.
